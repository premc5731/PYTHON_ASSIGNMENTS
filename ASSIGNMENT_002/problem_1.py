# 1.Create on module named as Arithmetic which contains 4 functions as Add() for addition, Sub()
# for subtraction, Mult() for multiplication and Div() for division. All functions accepts two
# parameters as number and perform the operation. Write on python program which call all the
# functions from Arithmetic module by accepting the parameters from user.
