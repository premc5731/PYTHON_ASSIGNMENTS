# 2.Design python application which creates two threads as evenfactor and  oddfactor. 
# Both the thread accept one parameter as integer. Evenfactor thread will display 
# addition of even factors of given number and oddfactor will display addition of odd 
# factors of given number. After execution of both the thread gets completed main thread should display message as “exit from main”.
