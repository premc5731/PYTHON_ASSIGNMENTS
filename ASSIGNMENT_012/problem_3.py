# 3. Write a program which contains one class named as Arithmetic.
# Arithmetic class contains three instance variables as value1 ,value2.
# Inside init method initialise all instance variables to 0.
# There are three instance methods inside class as Accept(), Addition(), Subtraction(),
# Multiplication(), Division().
# Accept method will accept value of value1 and value2 from user.
# Addition() method will perform addition of value1 ,value2 and return result.
# Subtraction() method will perform subtraction of value1 ,value2 and return result.
# Multiplication() method will perform multiplication of value1 ,value2 and return result.
# Division() method will perform division of value1 ,value2 and return result.
# After designing the above class call all instance methods by creating multiple objects.
